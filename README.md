# Color Classifier Web App

## Overview

This project is a simple web app that classifies colors based on their RGB hex values. Built with Flask, the app provides an endpoint where users can input a hex color code in the URL and get the color classification.

## Usage

To use the app:

1. Open your web browser.
2. Navigate to the following URL format: `https://colorclassifier.vercel.app/<color-code>`, where `<color-code>` is the hex color code without the `#` symbol.
   
   Example:  
   Visit `https://colorclassifier.vercel.app/ca7882` to classify the color with the hex code `#ca7882`.
